ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Owethu Peyane!

I'm a certified **Full-Stack Software Developer** with a strong passion for **quality assurance**, **test automation**, and building dynamic,
user-friendly web applications. I specialize in **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **modern web frameworks**, and I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, efficient code.

I thrive in both front-end and back-end development, with a solid foundation in:
- Functional and automated testing
- RESTful API development
- Database design and integration
- Agile development practices

I'm always learning and currently sharpening my **Node.js** and **test automation** skills through hands-on projects and certifications.

I'm actively seeking **entry-level opportunities** where I can grow, contribute to impactful products, and continue leveling up as a developer.

Letâ€™s connect and build something awesome!
